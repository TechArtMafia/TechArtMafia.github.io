# Mouse <> World 2
### Points and Rays
By itself, a point on screen does not describe a 3 dimensional position. You have to tell the game how far to go 'into' the screen.  

* If you want to just specify a distance, use a 'Point' method and pass in the distance as the Z component of the coordinate

* Use **[Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.ScreenToWorldPoint.html)** to find a world space position from a pixel position. You need to supply a depth value (in world units)
* Use **[Camera.WorldToViewportPoint](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.WorldToViewportPoint.html)** to do the same thing in Viewport space.

* If you want to test against the scene (looking for geometry or where you hit the ground plane) use a 'Ray' method

* **[Camera.ScreenPointToRay](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.ScreenPointToRay.html)** creates a **[Ray](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Ray.html)** at a pixel location
* **[Camera.ViewportPointToRay](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.ViewportPointToRay.html)** creates a **[Ray](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Ray.html)** at a viewport location
