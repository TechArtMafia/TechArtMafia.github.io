### Scripting basics

* Unity supports 3 languages
   * JavaScript, aka UnityScript
   * Boo 
   * C#
* All three languages can be used for all unity functions
  * But we're going to focus on C#
  * ...If you already know one of the others, you might want to develop that way on your own
* Key C# plusses
   * Automatic memory management
   * Great support for classes - the core of Unity programming
   * Lots of learning resources on the web
   * Strong type system prevents lots of beginner mistakes
* Key C# minuses:
   * Lots of typing
      * Capitalization and punctuation matter... a lot... :(
   * Strong types sometimes mean wordier code
   * Garbage collection (= automatic memory management) can pause game!
