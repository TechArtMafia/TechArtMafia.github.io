# Mouse <-> World


### 3d to 2d and back
Sometimes you'll want to convert a mouse position into a 3D world position. For example, you may need to convert a mouse click into a destination for a character

* The plane of the screen sits between the camera position and  the geometry
*  To convert mouse position into world position, we shoot a 'ray' out of the camera

### Screen vs viewport
The screen space is described in two ways, which mean the same thing but uses different units. 

* **Screen** space is in pixel positions from (0,0) at lower left to (width, height) at upper right.
* **Viewport** goes from (0,0) at lower left to (1,1) at top right
*  You don't need to do the math but remember to keep track of which one you're using.  
*  The **[Camera](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.html)** class handles the conversions
  *  **[Camera.ViewportToScreenPoint](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Camera.ViewportToScreenPoint.html)**
