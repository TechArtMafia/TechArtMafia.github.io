#Key Input Example

1. Create a new C# script in the project window (**Assets > Create > C# Script**)
2. Name it *KeyColor*
3. Open it in MonoDevelop
4. Add two fields inside the class (above **Start**):<pre>public Color BaseColor;
public ColorKey[] ColorKeys;</pre>
5. **ColorKey** is a new class - it doesn't exist in Unity (and won't show up in your auto-complete). We'll add it by going below the body of the class (**after** the last curly) and adding <pre>
[System.Serializable]
public class ColorKey
{
	public KeyCode Code;
	public Color Color;
}</pre>
This creates a simple class combining a Unity *KeyCode* and a Unity *Color.*  The bit in square brackets is an **[attribute](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z0w1kczw.aspx),** it tells Unity that it's OK to store this class on disk. If you make custom classes and want to use them in the editor, you'll have to mark them with **System.Serializable** (more details [here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Serializable.html));
