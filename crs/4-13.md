#Mouse Input

The **Input** class also contains fields and methods for checking the state of the mouse:

* **[Input.mousePosition](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input-mousePosition.html)**  returns the position of the mouse cursor on screen as a **[Vector3](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.html)**. Coordinates in pixels, with (0,0) being the bottom left corner.  The width and height of the screen are stored in **Screen.width** and **Screen.height**.  The Z component of the vector is always 0.
* **[Input.GetMouseButton](http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Input.GetMouseButton.html)** Tells if a particular mouse button is pressed. You provide an integer to ask for the left, right or middle buttons:<pre>leftButton = Input.GetMouseButton(0); // 0 = left
rightButton = Input.GetMouseButton(1); // 1 = right
middleButton = Input.GetMouseButton(2); // 0 = middle
</pre>
* **Input.GetMouseUp** and **Input.GetMouseDown** work the same way for the first frame after a button is pushed and after it is released, respectively.

You can combine mouse and keyboard functions to get modifiers, such as **Alt+Click**:
<pre>
if (Input.GetMouseButton(0) && Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftAlt)) {...}
</pre>
The two ampersands short hand for 'this is true and that is true. You can also use two | characters for "or that is true":<pre>
if (input.GetMouseButton(0) && (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftShift || KeyCode.RightShift)){...}</pre>
Note the use of parentheses to make the order clear: mouse button and *either* left or right shift key
