#Buttons and key presses

We've covered two different ways to use an input:

* Continuous inputs like joysticks (and faking them with keypresses)
* Continuous inputs from mouse or mousewheel

You can also use inputs to catch quick inputs like mouse buttons. 

* Go back to the input manager and take a look at the input called **Jump** 
* Note how high the **Gravity** and **Sensitivity** are set. This makes sure that a key press tied to this input is active only while the key (or joystick button) is actually held down. 
* The standard button input are **Jump (space bar)**, **Fire1 (Ctrl Key)**, **Fire2 (Alt Key) **, and **Fire3 (Cmd Key)**
* If you want to add more you can add them in the Input Manager by changing the **Size** field

You can use **Input.GetButton()** to get a true/false value from the input instead of **Input.GetAxis()**, which returns a float. For example<pre> if (Input.GetButton("Fire1") {.....}</pre>

* **GetButtonDown** is true once, when the 'button' is pressed
* **GetButton** is true as long the 'button' is held down 
* **GetButtonUp** is true once, when the 'button' is released
