This deserves it's own entry, even if it needs a bit of clean-up (any volunteers?).

Steve committed this excellant checklist from Rob Butterworth - now I'm linking to it.

I'm reworking this page right now as I transition over to [MDWiki](http://dynalon.github.io) -- which, I should say, is awesome.  So, right now this is pretty much placeholder (the nav bar does not work yet either).

Eventually this site will host some [unity course notes](crs/introduction-to-game-development-with-unity.md), though right now they are pretty busted :)
